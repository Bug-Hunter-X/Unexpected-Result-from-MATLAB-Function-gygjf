This repository contains a MATLAB function that produces an unexpected result due to a logical error in its conditional statements.  The `bug.m` file demonstrates the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.m` provides the corrected version.  The issue lies in how a conditional statement handles specific input values, leading to an incorrect output. This is a common issue when dealing with complex logic in MATLAB functions, and serves as an example for debugging and understanding proper conditional logic.
